# 1. Data Preparation
*   The code first unzips the dataset from Google Drive and installs the YOLOv8 package.
*   The dataset is divided into training, validation, and test sets. Images are preprocessed by resizing them to 640x640 pixels and normalizing pixel values.

# 2. Model Training
*   A pretrained YOLOv8 model (yolov8n.pt) is loaded for transfer learning.
*   The model is trained for 20 epochs with a batch size of 16 on the preprocessed dataset. This step fine-tunes the model to better detect objects specific to your aquarium dataset.

# 3. Model Testing
*   After training, the model is evaluated on a test set. Specific images from the test set are selected for inference.
*   The model's predictions on these test images are displayed and saved.

# 4. Evaluation Metrics
*   Metrics like precision, recall, and accuracy are computed by comparing the model’s predictions with ground truth labels.
*   The results also show the inference time, which provides insight into the model’s performance and efficiency for real-time applications.

# 5. Comparison with Other Models
*   The code concludes with a comparison of YOLOv8’s speed and accuracy with other models like HOG-SVM and SSD (Single Shot MultiBox Detector). It notes that YOLOv8 is better suited for real-time applications due to its faster inference times and improved accuracy on complex and small objects compared to these older detection methods.

# Results and Insights
*   Precision, Recall, Accuracy: The computed values for these metrics indicate how well the model performed in terms of correctly identifying objects within the test images. Higher values mean better performance.
*   Inference Time: This shows the model’s processing speed on test images, highlighting YOLOv8's potential for real-time detection.
